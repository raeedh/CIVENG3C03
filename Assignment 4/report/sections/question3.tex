\section*{Question 3}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item 
The superelevation value, $e$, used for the design is:
\begin{align*}
	e &= \frac{v^2}{127R} - f_s \\
	&= \frac{100^2}{127(475)} - 0.12 \\
	&= \frac{10000}{60325} - 0.12 \\
	e &\approx 0.046
\end{align*}

\item 
Using Monte Carlo Simulation, the mean and standard deviation of the superelevation needed for the horizontal curve are 0.01258 and 0.03503 (results may vary slightly as the simulation is repeated).

\item
Based on the Monte Carlo Simulation, the probability that the superelevation provided by the deterministic design will be inadequate is 1.74\% (results may vary slightly as the simulation is repeated).

\item
It is recommended to use the 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile as a design value. From the simulation, the 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile of the required superelevation is 0.07246. Hence, it is recommended to use $e = 0.0725$ as the design value (results may vary slightly as the simulation is repeated).
