\section*{Question 2}
The solution to Question 1 was redone using Excel solver, producing the same solution as the Simplex method using in question 1 as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:q2}. The solution is [X$_1$ = 1200, X$_2$ = 4000, X$_3$ = 4800] for a total profit margin of \$61200. The Excel spreadsheet is included with the assignment submission as \texttt{question2.xlsx}.
