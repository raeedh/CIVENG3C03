\section*{Question 2}
The solution to Question 1 was redone using Excel solver, producing the same solution as the Simplex method using in question 1 as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:q2}. The solution is X$_1$ = 1200, X$_2$ = 10000, and X$_3$ = 3085.71 for a total profit margin of \$62067.1. The Excel spreadsheet is included with the assignment submission as \texttt{question2.xlsx}.
