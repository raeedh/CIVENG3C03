\section*{Question 3}
To determine if the current production policy can be continued, we check the sensitivity of the optimal solution due to the changes in each of the cost coefficients. However, this is not possible to calculate with the information provided, as the final iteration of the simplex tableau does not provide the C$^i$ values for the final iteration, and this cannot be calculated without the previous iteration.
